TypeScript/Javascript Modules
Overview
This repository explores the concept of modules in TypeScript and JavaScript, 
highlighting their importance in structuring and organizing code for better maintainability and scalability.

Key Concepts
Modules
Modules in TypeScript/Javascript serve as containers to encapsulate related functionality within a file or set of files.
They allow for better code organization and reuse.

Exporting
With exports, specific functions, classes, or variables can be made accessible to other modules or files. 
This promotes modularity and code separation.

Importing
Imports bring functionalities from other modules into the current module,
facilitating code reuse and composition without global namespace pollution.
